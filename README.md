# Mistplay Data Engineer Take Home Challenge

--

## Task Description

You will be required to produce code to process and transform some sample data.
The sample data is in the file called `data.csv`.
Certain rows contain missing entries which you will need to handle appropriately.
There are also some duplicate rows.

The final product must be able to acheive the following
1. compute the rank of each user's `user_score` within each age group and output the rank in a new column called `sub_group_rank`
2. remove duplicates over the columns `id` and `createdAt`

You will be evaluated on correctness, scalability and maintainability of your code.

## Guidelines

1. You are allowed to use any language and any libraries you wish.
However, you should be able to justify your technical decisions.
2. Fork the github repo here (to be created) and use it to submit your work.
3. The challenge should not require more than a couple of hours to complete.
We don't want you to be spending too much time on it.
This being said, your code should be organized and well designed within reason.
